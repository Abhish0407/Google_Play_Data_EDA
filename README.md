# 📊 Google Play Store Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Google Play Store dataset to understand the structure, trends, and key insights from app-related data.

The goal of this analysis is to explore both **categorical and numerical features**, clean inconsistent data, and visualize important patterns that can help in understanding user behavior and app market dynamics.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about various apps available on the Google Play Store, including:

- App Category  
- Rating  
- Reviews  
- Size  
- Installs  
- Type (Free/Paid)  
- Content Rating  
- Android Version  
- Pricing  

---

## ✅ Key Tasks Performed

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and null entries  
- Cleaned inconsistent values in columns like **Size** and **Android Version**  
- Converted data types for proper analysis  
- Removed unwanted characters and formatted numeric columns  

---

### 📊 Categorical Feature Analysis
Performed analysis on categorical columns such as:

- App Category  
- Type (Free vs Paid)  
- Content Rating  
- Android Version  

Visualizations used:
- Countplots  
- Bar charts  
- Pie charts  

---

### 📈 Numerical Feature Analysis
Explored numerical columns such as:

- Rating  
- Reviews  
- Size  
- Installs  
- Price  

Techniques used:
- Distribution plots  
- KDE plots  
- Outlier understanding  
- Skewness interpretation  

---

### 📉 Data Visualization
Created multiple insightful visualizations including:

- Bar charts for category distributions  
- Pie charts for percentage breakdown  
- Combined multiple plots using **Matplotlib subplots**  
- Distribution analysis using Seaborn  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Most apps on the Play Store belong to a few dominant categories  
- App size distribution is highly right-skewed, indicating presence of large outliers  
- Free apps significantly outnumber paid apps  
- Ratings are mostly concentrated between 4.0 and 4.5  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Feature engineering for deeper insights  
- Correlation analysis between installs, reviews, and ratings  
- Building predictive models based on app features
